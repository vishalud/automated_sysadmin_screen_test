##Automated SysAdmin Screen Test 
Toolkit to help you screen sysadmin/devops candidates based on Rspec + Puppet

---------------------------------------------------------


Are you hiring Administrators/Devops in your Ops team? Do you need a better way to shortlist applicants remotely and automatically? and you want to present realworld problems to applicant and not just theoretical questions? 

**Automated SysAdmin Screen Test Toolkit (ASASTT)** allows you to write your interview test in **Rspec** and provision a problem environment using **Puppet** on your choice of hosting (local or AWS EC2). 

### How does it work?

* You formulate a creative sysadmin problem with puppet & rspec (something that can be solved in short time frame (like 15 min))
* The rspec tests describes the check for when problem is successfully solved
* You provision the server which also transfers encrypted rspec tests 
* Candidate logs-in, finds the instructions and finishes the problem or the time expires
* You run the test (which decrypts it) and provide you result on how many rspec examples passed and failed.


### Using the toolkit
There are two components in this toolkit
 
* **Supervillain** : This is the puppet part of the toolkit which allows you to provision target server but does some nasty modifications to the environment to make problem challenging
* **Litmus** : This is the rspec test suite which helps you perform the checks

### What kinda screening test can you create here?

Just look at the example [puppet manifest](https://github.com/parolkar/automated_sysadmin_screen_test/blob/master/supervillain/puppet/modules/destructor/manifests/test_1.pp)   & [rspec tests](https://github.com/parolkar/automated_sysadmin_screen_test/blob/master/litmus/spec/problem_1_spec.rb). That will give you an idea about sort of challenges that can be provisioned.

### Want to give it a try?

First thing you need to use this toolkit is [Vagrant 1.1+](http://www.vagrantup.com/) with [AWS provider](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws). Once you have that installed

* Clone the repo 
<pre>
  $ git clone git@github.com:vishalud/automated_sysadmin_screen_test.git asastt
  $ cd asastt
</pre>  
* Add Vagrant vbox for AWS
<pre>
  $ vagrant box add dummy https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws/raw/master/dummy.box
</pre> 

* Check what's in the supervilian's puppet manifests to [describe the challenge](https://github.com/vishalud/automated_sysadmin_screen_test/blob/master/supervillain/puppet/modules/destructor/manifests/test_1.pp)  
  
* Check what's in the [litmus/spec](https://github.com/vishalud/automated_sysadmin_screen_test/blob/master/litmus/spec/problem_1_spec.rb). You should have rspec tests corresponding to challenges described in supervilian. Perform spec packaging by supplying the password (which will be used when you run the test)
<pre>
  $ cd litmus
  $ ./package.sh
  Litmus packaging password: *****
</pre>  
  
* Create/modify configuration to supply your aws credentials before you can provision the test enviroment
<pre>  
  $ cd supervillain
  $ cp config/aws.rb.sample config/aws.rb
</pre>

* Provisioning is simple 
<pre> 
  $ cd supervillain
  $ vagrant up --provider=aws
    Bringing machine 'default' up with 'aws' provider...
    [default] Warning! The AWS provider doesn't support any of the Vagrant
    high-level network configurations (`config.vm.network`). They
    will be silently ignored.
    [default] Launching an instance with the following settings...
    [default]  -- Type: m1.small
    [default]  -- AMI: ami-7a4c2c13
    [default]  -- Region: us-east-1
    [default]  -- Keypair: screentest-keypair
    [default] Waiting for instance to become "ready"...
    [default] Waiting for SSH to become available...
    [default] Machine is booted and ready for use!
    [default] Rsyncing folder: /Users/star/workspace/automated_sysadmin_screentest/supervillain/ => /vagrant
    .
    .
    .
    
  $ vagrant ssh

    

               _   _              _   _            _
              | | | |            | | | |          | |
              | |_| | ___ _   _  | |_| | __ _  ___| | _____ _ __
              |  _  |/ _ \ | | | |  _  |/ _` |/ __| |/ / _ \ '__|
              | | | |  __/ |_| | | | | | (_| | (__|   <  __/ |
              \_| |_/\___|\__, | \_| |_/\__,_|\___|_|\_\___|_|
                           __/ |
                          |___/
               You can find the problems in /challenges directory
               You have full power on this machine, you are sudoer
                             Good luck :)

That's about it, you can now share the instance detail with the candidate and let her finish the task, once done you could log in to the server & run the test like this

<pre>
  # cd /litmus
  # ./run_litmus_test.sh
  (This will ask for the password)
   Problem 1:
    http://superstar.admin.com should return 200 status
    networking
      should not allow traffic from blocked IP addresses (165.4.45.3) (FAILED - 1)
   . . .
   Finished in 1.1 seconds
   200 examples, 198 failures
  
</pre>

This will decide if the candidate has passed the test or not
